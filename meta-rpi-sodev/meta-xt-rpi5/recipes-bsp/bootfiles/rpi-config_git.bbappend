#   kernel=u-boot + UART at the bootloader stage  -- U-Boot loads Xen.
#   CMA via the vc4-kms-v3d overlay parameter     -- a cmdline `cma=` kills the
#     RPi5 firmware mailbox (raspberrypi/linux#7230), so CMA has to be attached
#     to the dtoverlay line instead.
#   disable_fw_kms_setup=1                        -- DomD's vc4-drm owns HDMI.
#   usb_max_current_enable=1                      -- the RP1 USB touch panel
#     over-currents without it (needs a 5 A PSU).
#   V3D firmware DVFS bounds                      -- busy ceiling / idle floor.

# Xen/Arm disables cpufreq in EVERY guest, unconditionally, inside

#   arch/arm/xen/enlighten.c:511-514  (arm64 shares this file via
#                                      arch/arm64/xen/Makefile)
#     /* Making sure board specific code will not set up ops for
#      * cpu idle and cpu freq. */
#     disable_cpuidle();
#     disable_cpufreq();
#
# cpufreq_register_driver() then returns -ENODEV at its first check
# (cpufreq_disabled()), which surfaces at boot as:
#
#   cpufreq-dt cpufreq-dt: failed register driver: -19
#
# This applies to DomD too: being the hardware domain does not help, because the
# check is on "am I a Xen guest", not on privilege. So no in-guest governor can
# ever exist on this board.
#
# Everything below cpufreq is healthy, which is what makes the symptom easy to
# misread as a driver bug. Measured on the board:
#   * fw-clk-arm advertises clk_max_rate = 2400000000 and is bound to cpu0
#   * raspberrypi-clk probes and registers the raspberrypi-cpufreq device
#     (drivers/clk/bcm/clk-raspberrypi.c)
#   * raspberrypi-cpufreq binds and populates a complete OPP table --
#     /sys/kernel/debug/opp/cpu{0,1}/ held 10 OPPs, 1.5 to 2.4 GHz in 100 MHz
#     steps
#   * only cpufreq-dt fails, and it fails with no driver-specific message
# Nothing can consume that OPP table, so the firmware simply stays at its idle
# floor arm_freq_min. Measured: fw-clk-arm clk_rate = 1500000000, i.e. 62.5% of
# the 2.4 GHz this SoC is specified for, with no thermal or PSU reason
# (thermal_zone0 was 57 C and the pwm-fan sat at level 2 of 4).
#
# Setting the clock in the firmware is therefore not a workaround but the only
# available layer. min == max additionally removes DVFS jitter, which matters
# because this board is used for real-time latency measurement.
#
# Verified after applying: clk_rate/clk_min_rate/clk_max_rate all 2400000000,
# Dhrystone 21,505,376 -> 34,482,760 dps (1.60x, exactly the clock ratio) with
# DMIPS/MHz unchanged at 8.16 -> 8.18, all five domains up, 61.7 C, fan 2/4.
#
# CAUTION, and the reason the numbers above are worth keeping here: with cpufreq
# disabled the kernel cannot throttle the CPU at all. The thermal framework can
# only drive the fan (cooling_device0 = pwm-fan); thermal_zone0's trip points are
# 50/60/67.5/75 C "active" (fan steps) and 110 C "critical" (shutdown). The
# firmware's own temp_limit (default 85 C) is the effective thermal guard, so
# sustained full-load runs should record temperature.
