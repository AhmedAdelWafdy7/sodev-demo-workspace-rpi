# UART assignment: pl011 -> Bluetooth, mini UART -> the Xen console.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# BCM2711 has six UARTs, but only uart0 (pl011) and uart1 (mini UART) can be
# muxed to the two pin groups that matter here: GPIO14/15 (the 40-pin header) and
# GPIO30-33 (the on-board CYW43455 Bluetooth). uart2..uart5 are confined to
# GPIO0-15 and cannot reach the BT pins at all
# (arch/arm/boot/dts/broadcom/bcm283x.dtsi, and overlays/uart[2-5]-overlay.dts).
#
# The two pin groups are disjoint and uart0/uart1 are separate devices, so BOTH
# consumers can be served at once — which is what the stock, no-overlay
# configuration does. What is forced is only the PAIRING: whichever UART drives
# the BT module, the console gets the other one.
#
#   overlays          GPIO14/15 (header)          GPIO30-33 (BT module)
#   ----------------  --------------------------  ---------------------------
#   none (stock)      mini UART  (ttyS0)          pl011 @ 3 Mbaud
#   disable-bt        pl011                       nothing — BT is dead
#   miniuart-bt       pl011                       mini UART @ 230400
#
# The numbers decide the pairing. A UART at 8N1 carries baud/10 bytes per second,
# so the mini UART's 230400 gives 184 kbps of HCI payload while A2DP SBC needs
# 229 kbps (standard) to 328 kbps (high quality). miniuart-bt is therefore out —
# its own overlays/README says it "should only be used with low-bandwidth
# peripherals" — and disable-bt sacrifices Bluetooth entirely. pl011's 3 Mbaud
# (2400 kbps) is the only pairing that carries A2DP, so BT gets pl011 and the
# console gets the mini UART.
#
# No overlay at all is exactly that pairing: stock already puts pl011 on the BT
# module and lets the firmware mux GPIO14/15 to the mini UART as the primary
# UART. boot.cmd points Xen at the mini UART (dtuart=/soc/serial@7e215040), which
# is also the path meta-virtualization's stock RPi4 boot script takes. Measured on
# the board: hci0 binds under fe201000.serial, DomD's device tree reports
# max-speed = 3000000, and the controller answers with chip id 107,
# BCM4345C0 build 0382.
#
# enable_uart=1: the mini UART is the primary UART, so this is what gives the
# firmware stage a console on the header at 115200. Xen's ns16550 driver supports
# brcm,bcm2835-aux-uart directly (the compatible is in ns16550.c's DT match
# table, and ns16550_uart_dt_init() sets reg_width=4/reg_shift=2 from it) and
# uses BAUD_AUTO on the DT path, i.e. it reads the divisor the firmware
# programmed rather than reprogramming it.
#
# force_turbo=1 is NOT optional, and the coupling is documented upstream. The mini
# UART's parent clock is aux@7e215000 -> cprman index 20 = BCM2835_CLOCK_VPU, so
# its baud rate moves with the core frequency. Raspberry Pi's own documentation
# (configuration/interfaces.adoc, "Mini UART and core frequency") gives:
#
#   Mini UART set to | Core clock              | Result
#   -----------------+-------------------------+--------------------------------
#   Primary          | Variable                | Mini UART DISABLED
#   Primary          | Fixed (enable_uart=1)   | enabled; core fixed at 250 MHz
#                    |                         | (or turbo frequency if forced)
#   Secondary        | Variable                | Mini UART DISABLED
#   Secondary        | Fixed (core_freq=250)   | enabled
#
# So enable_uart=1 is itself what fixes the VPU clock, and it fixes it at 250 MHz
# — half the Pi 4's default core_freq of 500. That is not acceptable here: the
# core clock drives HVS (display composition), the VideoCore H.264 codec, and the
# L2 cache and memory bus, and this design hands the whole display complex to
# DomD. (V3D is separately clocked — v3d_freq/v3d_freq_min below — so it is not
# affected directly.) The documented escape is the parenthesis in the table,
# "or turbo frequency if forced".
#
# force_turbo=1 on its own does NOT set the warranty bit: upstream is explicit
# that "the overclock bit sets when force_turbo is set to 1 AND any of the
# over_voltage_* options are set to a value of more than 0", and nothing here sets
# over_voltage_*. It is also not overclocking — turbo is the stock maximum. Cost:
# all clocks stay at maximum even when idle, so idle power and temperature go up.
# Residual risk worth knowing: overclock/overvoltage are disabled at runtime when
# the SoC reaches temp_limit (85 C default), so under sustained thermal load the
# core can drop and the console baud with it — watch for garbled console output
# correlating with load.

# The pin mux for GPIO30-33 is done TWICE, and the duplication is deliberate.
# boot.cmd read-modify-writes GPFSEL3 and both PUP_PDN_CNTRL registers for all four
# lines before Xen starts, which is a strict superset of what the two `gpio=` lines
# below can do -- a config.txt `gpio=` reaches only GPIO32/33, and DomD's DT asserts
# uart-has-rtscts, so CTS0/RTS0 on GPIO30/31 have to be muxed as well.
#
# The `gpio=` lines are kept anyway because the configuration that was measured
# working on the board has both, and dropping one half of it has NOT been measured.
# Rewriting the SD card is the expensive step here, so the reduction is not worth
# spending a boot on; remove them only together with a board test that shows the
# read-modify-write alone brings the controller up (`chip id 107, BCM4345C0`).
#
# overlays/disable-bt.dtbo is still deployed as a p1 boot item (rpi4-sodev.yaml)
# and the kernel bbappend still forces KERNEL_DEVICETREE to build the overlay set.
# Nothing references the file, and keeping it means reverting this UART assignment
# costs one config.txt line plus boot.scr with no change to the FAT layout —
# rewriting the SD card is the expensive step on this board.

# hdmi0 / hdmi1 / ddc0 / ddc1 / dvp / aon_intr / txp / v3d / gpu and all five
# pixelvalves to status="okay" in the HOST device tree, i.e. it hands the display

# declares those nodes itself and takes them by direct-map passthrough.
#
# On rpi5 it happened to be harmless because no overlays/ directory was shipped, so

# deployed and overlays/disable-bt.dtbo is on the boot FAT as the rollback path
# for the UART assignment above, so anyone widening the p1 overlay list would
# silently enable it.
#
# VC4GRAPHICS is a recipe-local variable used at exactly one place (that `if`), so

# left alone — DomD's mesa / vc4-drm packaging and the vc4graphics.cfg kernel

#
# PRECISION(rpi4): this is not the same as "no framebuffer node is published".
# Two other things do that job, and both are needed:
#   * the boot scripts `fdt rm` the firmware framebuffer nodes before Xen boots;
#     and, because U-Boot's ft_board_setup() re-adds a `/framebuffer` node during
#     `booti` (AFTER those removals), they also set `skip_board_fixup 1`;
#   * the u-boot cfg drops CONFIG_VIDEO_BCM2835 so U-Boot never asks the
#     VideoCore for a framebuffer in the first place.
# See recipes-bsp/u-boot/files/rpi4-bcm2711.cfg for the full chain.

# gpu and all five pixelvalves to status="okay" in the HOST device tree. DomD does

# status="okay" — and enabling them host-side would only hand the ones this design
# deliberately does NOT pass through (pixelvalve0/1/3, vec) to the control Dom0.
